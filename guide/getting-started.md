# Getting Started

**Unplugin** is a library that offers an unified plugin system for various build tools. It extends the excellent [Rollup plugin API](https://rollupjs.org/plugin-development/#plugins-overview) to serve as the standard plugin interface, and provides a compatibility layer based on the build tools employed.

**Unplugin** current supports:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)
- [Rspack](https://www.rspack.dev/) <span style="color: #ca8a04"><strong>(⚠️ experimental)</strong></span>
